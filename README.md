## Talk Acceptance

All talks are still being considered. Talks will be accepted one at a time over the next few months. Because many events are structured in a narrative acceptance happens in the order we fill the narrative.

**You should still submit your talk! We are definitely still accepting them :)**

### Submissions

Create an issue in this repository. You can suggest a talk you'd like to give or one that you would like to see with or without a suggested speaker.

The idea doesn't have to be fully fleshed out and we're here to help.

### Format & Audience

Talks are 20 minutes. There is no time for Q&A after.

All talks are presented as part of a *narrative*. Don't worry about fitting your talk in to specific narrative, that's the job of the curator, and we may add new narratives based on the proposals we get.

### What makes a good talk

Don't talk about **a** technology, tell the story of what you **did** with that technology.

Nobody ever left a conference talk with enough information in their head to write a program from what they learned. For obvious practical reasons people learn and continue to follow documentation while writing software. Don't try to teach people what is already in the documentation, tell them a story that makes them care enough to follow up with that technology.
